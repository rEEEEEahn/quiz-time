## Installation
Creating this homework was quite difficult; having to create all of the code from scratch. I unfortunately, ran out of time toward the end of the assignment. You will see that the site is not quite finished, with elements that have not been polished and some elements not working. I am taking this homework as a lesson to really allocate more time to the assignments and not underestimate how long it will take.
